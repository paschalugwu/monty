/**
 * mod - computes the remainder of the division
 * @stack: stack given by main
 * @line_cnt: line counter
 *
 * Return: void
 * - The function  mod  takes a pointer to the stack and the line count
 * as arguments.
 * - It first checks if the stack is empty or if the stack has less than
 * two elements (top and next). If either condition is true, it prints an
 * error message indicating that the stack is too short and sets the
 * status  variable to  EXIT_FAILURE.
 * - It then checks if the value of the top element ( ((*stack)->n) ) is 0.
 * If it is, it prints an error message indicating division by zero and
 * sets the  status  variable to  EXIT_FAILURE.
 * - If the stack has at least two elements and the top element is not 0,
 * it calculates the remainder of the division of the second top element
 * and the top element by using the  %  operator.
 * - It calls the  pop  function to remove the top element from the stack.
 * - Finally, it updates the value of the new top element ( (*stack)->n )
 * with the calculated result.
